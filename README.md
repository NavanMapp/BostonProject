Academic records are important for various actors such as students, 
faculty members such as academic advisors and other staff in an academic institution. 
The Academic records maintenance system enables office bearers such as Faculty and Registration 
clerks to create profiles and add or update records of new academic achievements to the student’s profiles. 
The profile records are kept on a secure relational database. The Academic Record Maintenance System records
are accessible to certain system actors as depicted in the Use-Case Diagram below.

Required:
Create a Java software application for the above scenario using the NetBeans IDE with Java and MySQL. 
Users of the system must log into the system using unique usernames and passwords. 
The system must have different categories of users (actors) and distinguish the type of user and 
avail limited services as necessary for each use case or user category (e.g., creating profiles and 
adding records are only availed to the Registrar’s clerk).
